    <h2>Collonialism in Learning Courses</h2>
    <div class="date">September 16, 2025</div>
    <p>
      Graduated students who are known as fresh graduates really have a magnificent attraction. They are young, passionate, and still idealist. In this writing I am going to concern to the fresh graduates from education faculty. Most fresh graduates from education faculty still have good memorization of the way of teaching, the material of teaching, and the art of teaching. I could bet so because I, myself, am graduated from education faculty as well. In the near end of the learning period, each college student in this faculty experiences teaching practice for almost a half of a semester. All theories related to teaching which was got from the previous semester are practiced in this time. In this moment, either the good or the bad teacher- to be will be visible. This practice will finally be polished by final project making. All theories, practice, will be mixed well over there.
Unfortunately, this complete “package” is not supported by the quota of job vacancy as a teacher. Schools are full of the number of teachers already. The situation is, the number of education faculty graduates is unbalanced to the job availability.
This situation is actually beneficial to one side, learning courses that nowadays have been mushrooming. They can benefit the jobless graduates from education faculty by opening the vacancies to be the teacher in their courses. The graduates that mostly are still jobless finally seduced to join them.
            Actually there is nothing wrong with this kind of situation. What becomes the major problem is, if the employees (in this case is the graduated students) does not know at all about the importance of a work contract. In some local regions, it is a common thing if there is no specific written work contract between the employer and the employee. If the agreement is just shown in spoken form, it is very possible to trigger a problem in the next days. There are still learning courses that have no such formal work contract. As a result, if in the next day there is one side that is inflicted, no one can be blamed and be sued.
            I personally experienced this kind of situation actually. I was seduced to join a big learning course in my city; hopefully I could broaden my ability in teaching and find my prosperity. What happened then was really not something I expected before. I asked to be enabled seeing my work contract but I was not allowed. I did not like the management and I wanted to resign and I was not allowed as well. I was so inflicted, to be honest. I talked them wisely what reason actually that made me wanted to resign and so forth, but they still said not. What happened then was I insisted to resign. I stated my resignation by giving a letter. What I did was legally right. I resigned for the job that I never worked actually. Even if I did not give a letter, it would be right too. What they did was really an arbitrary action.
            In article 1 verse 14 (2003) of the law of manpower, it is stated that “Work agreement is an agreement between the employees/ labors with the industrialist or the employers which contains work requirements, right, and the obligation of them.” This states that all requirements, right, and obligation are really organized by the government. Therefore, this is the employer’s obligation to show up the contract. There should be an agreement between them and the employees.
Then in article 31 of the same law (2003), it says that “Every manpower has the same right and obligation to choose, to get, and to move away from a job and to earn the reasonable salary whether in or out of the country.” The meaning of this manpower law organization is actually to overcome the arbitrary action of every employer or the worker, include the owner of the learning courses. I did experience this kind of bad situation, where the learning course had a real arbitrary principle towards the workers.
            As conclusion, I am as the writer only can suggest to the graduated students who want to work in a learning course or anything like this, not to accept any job or work that has no real and clear work contract. Furthermore, I suggest them not to accept any job that does not respect their human resource and ability. It will be better to keep looking for and waiting for the good and the professional jobs rather than taking the non- professional ones. We are educated graduates, so we should be able to pick the best one of them.
